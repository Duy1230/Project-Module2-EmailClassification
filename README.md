# Project-Module2-EmailClassification

## Features
This project, "Email Classifier using Na誰ve Bayes Classifier," is a machine learning application that classifies emails as spam or not spam. The project uses the Na誰ve Bayes algorithm, which is particularly well-suited for text classification tasks. The model is deployed using Streamlit to provide an interactive web-based interface for users to classify their emails.

## Libraries and Tools

The following libraries are used in this project:
- **os**: For file and directory operations.
- **pickle**: For saving and loading the trained Na誰ve Bayes model.
- **sklearn**: For implementing the Na誰ve Bayes classifier and other machine learning utilities.
- **numpy**: For numerical operations and data manipulation.
- **pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **string**: For string manipulation and text preprocessing.
- **nltk**: For natural language processing, including text tokenization and stopword removal.
- **Streamlit**: For deploying the application as a web interface.
